      desc: "The resource server provides data access through search, count, subscription APIs. The APIs for these functionalities can be constructed using the following sub-modules.  <br> <ul> <li>Resource Server ID</li> <li>Resource Group ID</li> <li>Verbs, Queries and Filters</li> </ul> Authentication and Authorization for the resource server interface is through the use of IUDX tokens issued by the IUDX Authorization Server. All the APIs of the resource server interface accept the IUDX auth token using the auth-token header. If a token is not provided then the APIs operate only on publicly available data sets or service-offerings. However, when a token is supplied, the resource server interface discerns the scope of the token after contacting the IUDX auth server and performs operations on all those resources instead of only restricting the operation to public resources. More information on the IUDX authorization token can be found at"
